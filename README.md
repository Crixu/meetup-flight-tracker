# Meetup Flight Tracker POC

This is a quick and rough example of a meetup flight tracker.

The idea is to be able to check the prices from multiple origins to a single destination so we can compare them.

## Requirements

This requires a valid Amadeus API set of keys.

[How to get started with Amadeus.](https://developers.amadeus.com/get-started/get-started-with-self-service-apis-335)

After you have your API keys, place them in the `.env` file (see the `.env.example` for the keys)

## How to run
Execute `npm run dev` and go to localhost:3000 in your browser
